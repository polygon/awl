Exploring and Decoding Nikons Advanced Wireless Lighting protocol with Python

Also my attempt to get rid of the proprietary Matlab for private things and
replace it with a combination of Python, Numpy, Matplotlib and other intersting
libraries.

Currently mostly experimental and probably not the best code since I'm just
getting into Python. And since I'm mostly porting my old Matlab code for now I
may carry over some bad habits.
